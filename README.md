# Welcome to my Nix flake!

This is my repo I use to store my flake for my NixOS and non-NixOS systems, it includes a home-manager configuration that (should) work both standalone and as a NixOS module, which manages an MPD server, swayfx (hyprland has godawful vram management and i will die on this hill), waybar, and some other stuff that I can't think of on the top of my head lmao

## PLEASE NOTE ALL MY BINDINGS ARE MADE WITH THE [COLEMAK](https://colemak.org) KEYBOARD LAYOUT IN MIND AS I USE IT ON MY MACHINES
